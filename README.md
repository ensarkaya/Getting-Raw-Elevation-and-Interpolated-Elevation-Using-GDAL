# Getting-Raw-Elevation-and-Interpolated-Elevation-Using-GDAL
This project is about getting raw elevations of pixels and getting interpolated elevation of specific points from a GeoTiff map by using GDAL library.  
Implementation Language: C++   
You have to download and setup gdal library to implement this project. I uploaded a map for test purposes.
